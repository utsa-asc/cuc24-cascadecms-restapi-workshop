        /* Step 1.1: Locate the video block used on the index page (/blocks/video/video-1) and add asset id on line 19 */

                using dot notation, we drill down the object property (page XML nodes) until we reach the specific node (field) we want
                since this is a data definition block and the fields we want to edit are data definition fields, we want to look at the structure data nodes */

                here, we're inside the video structure data node, you can confirm that by outputting the node identifier
                inside the video node, there are 3 nodes, 1 for each field in the data definition 
                each node will the following properties: type, identifier, text, etc
                most data definition fields that take in a value will have type as text 
                the identifier is the ID you give the field in the data definition 
                the text is the actual value in the field, if the node doesn't have a text property, that means the field is empty/blank   */

                this could also be done without defining multiple node vars
                the array positions [] are great for data definitions that don't have any repeatable groups/fields */
